Guacamole

Ingredients:
2 Avocados
Rocket fuel
dirt

Directions:
Mash avocadoes, set aside. Pour rocket fuel on dirt and ignite. Burn until dirt has turned to glass. Throw avocadoes into space until they freeze. Catch avocadoes after re-entry and place them on glassified dirt. Microwave on high until mashed avocado is indistinguishable from glassified dirt. Using oven mitts, throw guacamole at passing traffic.
